About
-----

I am interested in *UK Political Betting* and have been collecting data from Betfair since mid-2014. Here you can find some Exploratory Analysis of ~700 Betfair markets related to the coming General Election, i.e. all the sub-branches of [this page](http://www.betfair.com/exchange/?nodeId=MENU:2707982).

This Project if about Getting, Cleaning, and Exploratory Analysis of those odds.
