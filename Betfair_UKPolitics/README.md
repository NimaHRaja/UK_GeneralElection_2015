Betfair_UKPolitics
=======================

*Betfair* offered more than 800 different *2015 General Election Political Betting* markets. The purpose of this project was to collect and to analyse those odds.

R codes in /Codes were used to get, clean, and preprocess data (some of which in /raw_data) and save them in .csv format - **Betfair_UKPolitics_Odds_History.csv** - with the following 6 columns:
- Market 
- Outcome
- Date_char
- Back
- Lay
- Matched
